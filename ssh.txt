Why SSH is used?
SSH is typically used to log into a remote machine and execute commands, but it also supports tunneling, forwarding TCP ports and X11 connections; it can transfer files using the associated SSH file transfer (SFTP) or secure copy (SCP) protocols. SSH uses the client-server model


What is SSH private key?
A host key is a cryptographic key used for authenticating computers in the SSH protocol. Host keys are key pairs, typically using the RSA, DSA, or ECDSA algorithms. Public host keys are stored on and/or distributed to SSH clients, and private keys are stored on SSH servers.



What is public key authentication?
SSH public-key authentication relies on asymmetric cryptographic algorithms that generate a pair of separate keys (i.e., a key pair), one "private" and the other "public". You keep the private key a secret and store it on the computer you use to connect to the remote system	


What is SSH key authentication?
SSH, or secure shell, is an encrypted protocol used to administer and communicate with servers. When working with a Linux server, chances are, you will spend most of your time in a terminal session connected to your server through SSH. ... SSH keys provide an easy, yet extremely secure way of logging into your server.
